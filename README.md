# How do NN work
Trying to understand the internals of NN and why do they work

## Goal of the project
This repository will contain code to understand how NN work. The idea is to build from the bottom to top.

 - create a neuron cell
 - connect multiple cells on a net
 - build a basic back-propagation
 - train the NN to learn simple problems
    - train with an equation
    - train with data from a simple model
 - try to understand what is happening inside of the network for this simple problems

## Tools
Initial idea is to start writing simple Python3 code for the modeling of the NN components, then maybe go to Keras for more sofisticated stuff.
